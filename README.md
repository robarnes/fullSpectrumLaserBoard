5th Gen Full Spectrum Laser :: Cohesion Laserboard

This is my config file for my FSL laserboard conversion.  Primary changes to stock file are:

- Home to X(Alpha) Max instead of Min
- Increase current on both axis' stepper motors
- Increase work area (500x300)
- Don't go to origin after homing (personal preference)
